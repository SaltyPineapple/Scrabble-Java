Scrabble Brainstorming


Classes needed
    Tile
    Linked list
    Board
    Player

Other things
    Web Based API - Webster dictionary


Tile:
    Much like a cell class
    Data:
        Letter
        Point Value
        x and y

Linked List
    As usual
    May need to make double linked

Board
    Grid
    point value spaces

Player
    Data:
        tiles in hand (ArrList)
        Points

    Draw function

    basics:
        grab tile from tileset
        add to hand
        already have function grab from tileset
        draw(Tile tile)
        tile will be added to hand
        call with tile from grab

    play function

    shuffle function




for getting words
need some sort of algorithm to get the neighbors.
Traverse the neighbors until there is nothing next.
(Traverse backwards until we reach the smallest x or y)
this is start of word
Start there and add each tile to a LL
go until end of word.
return that

foreach neighbors touching
run alg to put in LL

if cell has char and is not occupied,
that cell is flagged for checking
need to go all the way back until you reach one
that has one in that direction that is blank.


what does it look like to play on the board
1. at least one tile has to neighbor previous tiles.
2. place all tiles neighboring each other in any order
3. press play tile.

should have it check the api every time you place a tile.
then can click play if valid

TILE GET NEIGHBORS
ok so
check neighbors, add all straight line tiles to a list
when tile is played, check the neighbors.
if there are any neighbors, check the direction they are going
ie-> x or y direction
add all same direction neighbors to LL

when you play a tile, grab the neighbors and add to LL
check immediately with dictionary, if it returns false
stop, cannot play word at this point.


fix tile placement valid word problem
bool is always true
if word is invalid set to false
no other way to reset to true besides pulling all pieces off



check for valid placement
- borders previous tiles
- straight line

when first tile is played, get row and col
mark those as possible.
when second tile is played, check if it is
    in either of those row/col, mark accordingly
anything outside of that row/col deems play invalid



for bordering tiles
    check all tiles and check neighbors
    if none have a tile that is not in list
    false

    new function solely for checking if borders
        passes in word LL
        loops through and checks if surrounding tiles are occupied


need some way to flag cells that have current word playing
when tile is played, set is current to true for that cell
when word is successfully played
    set is current to false for all of those


since we now have current flag
can run an eastwest northsouth on all current tiles,
create 2d list of words it makes
arrayList of linked lists
