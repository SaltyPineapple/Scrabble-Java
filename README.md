# Scrabble Java Project

Hello and welcome to my Scrabble Java project

I have created this to practice my skills in data structures and algorithms. This project uses Arrays and Linked Lists as the main data structures. I also have multiple recursive alrogithms in here.

I also am learning the use of external REST/API and I use one for looking up validity of words in a dictionary.

The end goal for this project is to create a mobile app developed in Android Studio. I am currently diving deep and learning all I can about Android Studio through the use of Google Codelabs.

Currently I have mostly finished the logic of the game, though it is still in the command line stages as I have not started to develop it as an app quite yet.
I hope to do that soon!

Thank you for viewing my project!
